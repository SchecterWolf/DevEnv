Dev/tools are series of scripts that help with dev of the arduino and circuit/micro python
programs, more specifically, for the synth project.

Make sure to add this directory to your $PATH

Anything that can be a quality-of-life benefit during dev should be made to run as a script and
placed into this dir. Who knows, maybe more people will work on this project with me and these
scripts will be helpful to everyone, if even your future self :)
